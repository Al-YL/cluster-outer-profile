# Project Task List

This is a living task list for the Galaxy Cluster Outer Regions research project. Please edit and check off items as they are completed. Assign owners in parentheses.

## High-Level Milestones
- [ ] Define sample selection and target clusters (PI)
- [ ] Collect and catalog available data (all)
- [ ] Establish standard data reduction pipelines (X-ray, optical, SZ leads)
- [ ] Produce baseline radial profiles (density, temperature, pressure, entropy)
- [ ] Cross-compare multi-wavelength results and with simulations
- [ ] Draft first paper outline

## Data Acquisition & Cataloging
- [ ] Compile target list and metadata (RA/Dec, z, instruments)
- [ ] Optical: download imaging/spectroscopy (e.g., DES, HSC, SDSS)
- [ ] X-ray: download data (e.g., Chandra/XMM) from HEASARC/ESAC
- [ ] SZ: download maps/catalogs (e.g., Planck/ACT/SPT)
- [ ] Create `data/README.md` with dataset descriptions and access notes

## X-ray Pipeline
- [ ] Standard reduction and flare cleaning
- [ ] Background modeling and subtraction
- [ ] Point source detection and masking
- [ ] Spectral extraction in radial annuli
- [ ] Temperature and metallicity profiles

## Optical Pipeline
- [ ] Source extraction and star/galaxy separation
- [ ] Cluster member selection (photometric/spectroscopic)
- [ ] Galaxy density maps and LSS context
- [ ] Brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) identification

## SZ Pipeline
- [ ] Map filtering and beam deconvolution
- [ ] Compton-y radial profiles
- [ ] Pressure profile modeling

## Cross-Comparison & Modeling
- [ ] Joint X-ray+SZ pressure and temperature constraints

- [ ] Compare with simulations (e.g., The300, IllustrisTNG, Magneticum)
- [ ] Entropy and clumping factor analysis in outskirts

## Infrastructure & Collaboration
- [ ] Set up conda env and Jupyter kernels
- [ ] Define data naming conventions (docs/data_management.md)
- [ ] Meeting cadence and notes in `docs/meetings/`
- [ ] Paper bibliography management in `docs/papers/`

## Paper 1 Outline (Draft)
