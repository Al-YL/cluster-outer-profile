# Data Directory

This folder contains catalogues used in the Galaxy Cluster Outer Regions project. Note, it is not possible to upload all the raw data to GitHub. We only provide the catalogues here and give a link to the raw images.

- `DESI/`: DESI galaxy cluster catalogues
- `ACT/`: ACT catalogues
- `eROSITA/`: eROSITA catalogues

Large files should not be committed directly unless tracked with Git LFS.
